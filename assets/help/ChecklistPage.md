Where you actually complete the choosen checklist.

There are two kinds of checklist items:
1. Regular items
2. Linearity check items

## Regular
Regular items only need to be checked to be considered done.

They can, optionally have 3 extra resources:
1. **Countdown timer**: helps with items that need to account for some elaped time before being considered completed. The countdown is just a helper. You can check the item vefore the countdown is complete. You don't even need to start the countdown if you donÂ´t need it. With a long press, you can change the duration of the countdown.
2. **Value register**: usefull to register some value of interest: sensor milivolts, battery charge, etc.
